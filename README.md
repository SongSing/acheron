## Setup

You will need to import tokens from `src/tokens` when you first start the app. Just select all of the folders in there.

## Troubleshooting

>I don't have any tokens to work with.

Did you follow the setup...?

>My composition won't load after moving folders around.

You will need to ensure your search paths are correct in the Token Manager.

>I have another issue!

Contact me through the issues section of Github or however else you know how to contact me and I'll help.

## Development

`yarn start` will start the app in the `dev` environment.

Custom tokens can be created and distributed without setting up a development environment.
See [Token_Documentation.md](./Token_Documentation.md) for more information.
