## About

Electron-based recreation of https://github.com/mmower/elysium

Built with https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate

## Troubleshooting

> My composition won't load after moving folders around.

Right now, tokens are saved by path in a composition file. I'll figure out a better way to do this eventually. You need to modify your composition file in a text editor and remedy the token paths.

> I have another issue!

Contact me through the issues section of Github or however else you know how to contact me and I'll help.

## Development

`yarn start` will start the app in the `dev` environment.

Custom tokens can be created and distributed without setting up a development environment.
See [Token_Documentation.md](./Token_Documentation.md) for more information.
